I want to match Piwik user IDs to email addresses.

Consider this scatterplot matrix.

    ggplot(cube) +
      aes(y = email_count, x = piwik_visit_count) +
      facet_grid(email_person ~ piwik_visitor_id)

I want to select the scatterplots with high correlations
within this matrix.


SELECT *
FROM cube_piwikemailoverlap
WHERE email_address != ''
  AND intersecting_dates >= 2
ORDER BY
  email_address,
  100 * intersecting_dates / unioned_dates
DESC;
