Terminal commands
    From shell history files
Calendar events
    http://thomaslevine.com/schedule
Facebook messages
    Facebook messages that people have sent me (not messages I have sent)
Facebook chat status changes
    When people go online and offline
Twitter notifications
    When people direct message, follow, &c. me.
GnuCash splits
    Along with their transactions, accounts, &c.
All my emails
    With ordinary email fields

How to use
=======================================
Install the package. ::

    pip3 install .

Start loading the data. ::

    dada-load

Loading the data will take a while, but you don't have to wait until it's
finished before you can start analyzing; just run this in another shell. ::

    dada-model

More ideas of sources of data
========================================
Here are some other possible cubes or data sources.

* Git commits
* Project pages (``pip install tlevine``)
* Emails, possibly broken out as
  * Notifications from various services
  * Sent emails
  * Mailing lists
  * Travel bookings
  * ...
* Old calendar (Google Calendar)
* Other Google services, mainly for stuff from years ago
* Text messages
* Meetup.com history
* Facebook chat
* Server logs
* Piwik database
* Mutt aliases

Some tables to create to assist in the creation of these tools

* Unique identifiers for people with links to email addresses, phone
    numbers, &c.
* Cities I've been in, people I stayed with


Structure of the repository
==============================

``doeund``
    A separate package for assembling a model from sqlalchemy
``warehouse/{main,model,logger}.py``
    Overall configuration of the data warehouse
The rest of ``warehouse``
    Connectors to different data sources
``mastering``
    Assemblage of master data

How to use doeund
==============================
By following doeund's conventions, you can produce at once the

1. Database schema
2. Mapping with Python objects
3. Cubes model

In addition, doeund assists you in creating snowflake schemas with many layers.


Fun ideas
==============================

* How many spaces after a period?
* Connect website views to emails
* Length of sentences (Saar Golde's idea)

To do
==========
It looks like mappings need to map dimensions to table *aliases*,
not tables themselves. Do joins have to be on aliases too...?

Front-ends to consider
===============================
My original plan was `cubes <http://cubes.dadabrewery.com>`_, but it doesn't
work as it is documented.

I can get an installation of BusinessObjects for $150/month on Amazon EC2.
The AMI is called "SAP BusinessObjects 5 Named Users - BASIC". Or maybe that's
$150/month plus about $12/hour.

Microstrategy is $1/hour with the AMI
"MicroStrategy Analytics Enterprise with SQL Server Standard (25 users)".

I can get Oracle and Microsoft databases from Amazon RDS. Maybe they have
OLAP servers? Well Microsoft does, but the Oracle one is confusing me.

And then there are a bunch of clients for MDX.

Hmm Mondrian looks okay actually.
