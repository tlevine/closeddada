This is the Xapian error that I need to catch. ::

    q = notmuch.Query(db, '')
    a = q.search_messages()
    In [106]: next(a)
    A Xapian exception occurred when reading header: The revision being read has been discarded - you should call Xapian::Database::reopen() and retry the operation
    Out[106]: <repr(<notmuch.message.Message at 0x7f9ced3c8048>) failed: notmuch.errors.NullPointerError: >
